After your suggestions I was going through my home feed, on Facebook, and I ran across this picture that sparked a need in me to share a story about the cruelty that many horses face in how bits and cavasons are used and how we need to change our attitude and treatment of horses.',

        preview: "Someone recently said to me that she had watched me, Richard Winters and some of the other well known horsemen train and had seen the results and the progress a horse could make in one session. She said that when she went home and tried to do the same things, she had difficulties and did not get the same results. She wanted to know what she was doing wrong. I suspect she is not the only one who may have experienced this but I don't believe it is a matter of doing anything wrong unless there is a lack of understanding in how to do a specific exercise. There is however, a learning curve when working with horses.",

        preview: "Albatross started life as a small cold out of an unproven mare. No one wanted him. As if that wasn't bad enough, he had that awful name. He wasn't a big, web-footed bird. A group of five men got together to purchase the mare, Voodoo Hanover, and have her bred to Meadow Skipper. The result was Albatross-basically a cull (not a gull). The mare was bred again. This time she had a filly. Nothing much to brag about.",

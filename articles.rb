        title: 'Bit And Cavasons Cruelly Used On Horses And A Horse Named Babe',
        preview: 'As you all know, who are my Facebook friends, I was struggling on a topic for my next blog. After your suggestions I was going through my home feed, on Facebook, and I ran across this picture that sparked a need in me to share a story about the cruelty that many horses face in how bits and cavasons are used and how we need to change our attitude and treatment of horses.',

        title: 'Getting Results From Your Training',
        preview: 'Someone recently said to me that she had watched me, Richard Winters and some of the other well known horsemen train and had seen the results and the progress a horse could make in one session.

I suspect she is not the only one who may have experienced this but I donâ€™t believe it is a matter of doing anything wrong unless there is a lack of understanding in how to do a specific exercise. There is however, a learning curve when working with horses.',
